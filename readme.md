# Story Tree

[Story Tree](http://hidden-taiga-61254.herokuapp.com/) is a web application for creating and sharing branching stories.

Project planning is conducted in [Trello](https://trello.com/b/56ArLGeq/ga-sei-project-3).

## Purpose

I like to read visual novels and branching stories, but the people who are writing them often have to have at least a little programming knowledge or team up with a programmer to bring their creations to life.

Story Tree was created for authors who want to write branching stories with minimal technical knowledge. Its purpose is also to display those creations to people who want to read the stories.

### Users
#### Story Author
The 'story author' is a casual writer who wants to create a branching story and share it publicly. Because they do not have coding skills, they need a tool to create the branches in their story.
#### Story Reader
The 'story reader' wants to read a custom branching story. They have either arrived at the site via a link to a specific story that has been shared, or they have picked a story after browsing the list.
