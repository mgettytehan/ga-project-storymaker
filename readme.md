# Story Tree

[Story Tree](http://hidden-taiga-61254.herokuapp.com/) is a web application for creating and sharing branching stories.

Project planning is conducted in [Trello](https://trello.com/b/56ArLGeq/ga-sei-project-3).

## Purpose
A casual author without coding knowledge would like to write branching stories and share them with friends or publicly.

### Users
#### Story Author
The 'story author' is a casual writer who wants to create a branching story and share it publicly. Because they do not have coding skills, they need a tool to link the parts of their story together.
#### Story Reader
The 'story reader' wants to read a custom branching story. They have either arrived at the site via a link to a specific story that has been shared, or they have picked a story after browsing the list.
