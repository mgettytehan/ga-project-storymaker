# Story Maker (TBC)

### Users
#### Story Author
The 'story author' is a casual writer who wants to create a branching story and share it publicly. Because they do not have coding skills, they need a tool to link the parts of their story together.
#### Story Reader
The 'story reader' wants to read a custom branching story. They have either arrived at the site via a link to a specific story that has been shared, or they have picked a story after browsing the list.
